### CPSC 120

* Lab 6 

    Lab 6, part 3 was a favorite because it had taught me how the game blackjack works. It was very fun learning these technicalities and then writing code to show how the code works when getting a score. I remember there was a challenge I had faced and it felt great when I had solved it. 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 and 2 are one of my favorites because we were able to revisit a program we had coded from a past lab. The difference was that we had to create functions which was something I had enjoyed when I took a Java class in highschool. It made everything more organized and it was very satisfying. 

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 is a favorite of mine because we had used a header file. This was something new to me that I did not do in Java. It was nice to see it come all together when running the program.
